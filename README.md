# Stock-Price-Prediction-with-LSTM-Neural-Network

This project demonstrates how to predict stock prices for the next thirty days using historical data from Yahoo Finance, visualize trends with Plotly, and forecast future prices using LSTM models in Keras. Although Tesla (TSLA) stock is used as a case study, the script can be easily adapted for any other stock by substituting the ticker symbol.

## Overview

The project involves the following steps:
1. **Retrieve Historical Data**: Fetch stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
2. **Visualize Data**: Create candlestick charts for data visualization.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Analyze correlation of features with closing prices.
4. **Prepare Data for Forecasting**: Split the data into training and testing sets.
5. **Build and Train LSTM Model**: Use Keras to construct and train an LSTM model.
6. **Make Predictions**: Predict future stock prices using the trained model.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to install the required libraries. 


# Usage
## Retrieve Historical Data
The script fetches historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library. To use this for different stocks, change the ticker symbol (e.g., 'TSLA' for Tesla) in the code.

## Visualize Data
The script uses Plotly to create interactive candlestick charts for visualizing stock price movements.

## Correlation Analysis
Calculate and display the correlation of features with the closing price.

## Prepare Data for Forecasting
Split the data into training and testing sets and reshape for model input.

## Build and Train LSTM Model
Construct and train an LSTM model using Keras for time series forecasting.

## Make Predictions
Use the trained model to make stock price predictions.

## Adapting for Different Stocks
To predict prices for a different stock, simply substitute the desired stock ticker symbol (e.g., 'AAPL' for Apple) in the data retrieval section of the script.
